## About Me

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Bonn, advised by [Prof. Dr. JÃ¼rgen Gall](http://gall.cv-uni-bonn.de/).
My research is currently focused on video generation and prediction, multi-modal learning, and world models.
I'm also working on agriculture application of video prediction models for crop monitoring and forecasting as part of the [AID4Crops project](https://aid4crops.uni-bonn.de/index.html).
